# Defederation

We defederate (aka Fediblock) vmst.io from other servers that are incompatible with our fundamental rules, in an effort to protect our users and limit our liability.
We would rather be proactive in blocking bad actors versus waiting for abuse to happen.

The full list of defederated servers is available [from Mastodon](https://vmst.io/about).

## Sources

As of December 9, 2024, we leverage the [IFTAS FediCheck](https://connect.iftas.org/library/iftas-documentation/fedicheck/) platform to automatically manage our defederations.

- We choose to use the high-consensus 66% threshold setting for our suspension (blocked) list to prevent breaking connections from users unnecessarily.
- We may also choose to manually issue limitations (mute) servers, outside of what FediCheck will issue.
- We also have a handful of manually issued blocked servers to aid in enforcement of our [anti-Bridging](/rules/bridges) policy.
