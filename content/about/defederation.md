# Defederation

We defederate (aka Fediblock) vmst.io from other servers that are incompatible with our fundamental rules, in an effort to protect our users and limit our liability.
We would rather be proactive in blocking bad actors versus waiting for abuse to happen.

The full list of defederated servers is available [from Mastodon](https://vmst.io/about).

## Sources

In addition to instances which are manually added by our administrative staff, we regularly import the following sources:

- [IFTAS DNI](https://connect.iftas.org/library/iftas-documentation/iftas-dni-list/)
- [IFTAS CARIAD](https://cariad.fedicheck.iftas.org/)
