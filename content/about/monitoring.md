We use integrated metrics available through DigitalOcean's managed services platform to monitor and alert on CPU, memory, disk, and other performance metrics of the host virtual machine and managed database systems.

Additionally, we use their monitoring service to monitor worldwide network latency and availability for our Mastodon and Streaming API endpoints.

Our administrators are notified via email when there are issues.
