# Bots

We have several internal Bots:

- <a rel="me" href="https://vmst.io/@iostat">@iostat</a>
- <a rel="me" href="https://vmst.io/@mergebot">@mergebot</a>

If you're interested in starting a Bot account, we encourage you to reach out to a member of our staff ahead of time to make sure that it's an appropriate fit for our site.
Once created, it must be clearly designated as a Bot in the account bio and have an identification of who maintains it and how they can be contacted.

Bot accounts that boost or crosspost content from other social networks, without the consent of the content owners, are prohibited.
