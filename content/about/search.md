# Search

Search in Mastodon and the wider Fediverse can be a confusing topic.

There are two levels of search supported by Mastodon:

- Basic Search
- Full Text Search

The availability of the more advanced full text searching depends on whether your server has implemented additional indexing infrastructure.

On vmst.io we have full text search backended by our dedicated search indexing server ([Khan](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Khan_Noonien_Singh)) which is a 2 vCPU x 8GB RAM managed OpenSearch instance hosted at DigitalOcean.

## Basic Search

By default, Mastodon has limited abilities to allow searching of hashtags and to display recent posts made with that tag, using data stored in the primary PostgreSQL database.
Including a hashtag in your post can make that post discoverable by anyone else who might click on the hashtag in the interface.

Anything that is posted with a hashtag may be found by local users or federated other servers and discoverable by searching for that hashtag.

## Full Text Search

If an administrator chooses to implement it, Mastodon can integrate with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) or [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org) to provide the ability to do additional searching on:

- Usersâ€™ profile information (unless they opt-out)
- Full text search of **your own** posts (including alt-text data)
- Full text search of replies to **your own** posts
- Any other post that **you** have directly interacted with (bookmarked, marked as a favorite, or boosted)
- **Any post** from users who **opt-in** to full text search indexing.

_How will I know if full text searching is enabled?_

When you start searching, the dropdown will say "Posts matching ..." your term.
If you don't see this, full text searching is not enabled.

### Opt-In Indexing

Starting in Mastodon 4.2, full text search will also include posts for anyone who opts-in to letting their own server, and other Mastodon servers, return any full text search results for their posts.

This opt-in process can be done in Preferences > [Privacy & Reach](https://vmst.io/settings/privacy) under "Include posts in search results."

- If you choose not to opt-in, users may still be able to search for your posts by viewing a hashtag if you've used one, or by doing full text searching **if they have previously interacted with your post**, as outlined above.
- If you choose not to opt-in, this **does not** impact your ability to perform full text searching for other people's content, or your own.
- If you choose not to opt-in, **your own post data is available to you via search** regardless of other people's ability to search for it.
- If you opt-in to full indexing and later decide you no longer want to participate, **you're free to change this setting**.
- Any changes to this setting take effect instantly for local members doing searches against your account, but may take time for the change to federate out to other servers.

Like any other profile update, the changes are queued to immediately be sent to other servers but for any number of reasons may fail to be received by all servers.
Mastodon does additional polling of remote user profiles to make sure the `indexable` flag and other profile data is up-to-date.

#### Per Post Opt-Out

If you have opted your account into full indexing, but wish to not have an individual post discoverable, you can opt that post out by setting the post visibility to "Unlisted" instead of public.

Follower only and private mentions are also not discoverable to other users.

### Opt-Out Profile Discovery

Users can also opt-out of their profile biographical information being returned in search results, by visiting the Preferences > [Privacy & Reach](https://vmst.io/settings/privacy) under "Feature profile and posts in discovery algorithms."

Changing this setting is not recommended.

### Unauthorized Indexing

The `discoverable` and `indexable` settings are federated to other Mastodon servers running version 4.2 beta 2 or higher, as well as other Fediverse software platforms that recognize this flag.

However, some servers may side-step some of the privacy concerns and implement an different full text search method which does not respect this `indexable` flag, while other Fediverse projects and forks have done so in their own ways.

vmst.io has limited controls over how other federated platforms index your posts.

## Search Modifiers

The following search modifiers are available on vmst.io, and other servres Mastodon 4.2 or higher:

| Operator        | Modifies search to                                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `from:me`       | Posts you've made                                                    |
| `in:library`    | Posts you have previously interacted with (favorite/boost)           |
| `from:username` | Posts from a specific user                                           |
| `has:image`     | Posts that include an image                                          |
| `has:video`     | Posts that include a video                                           |
| `has:audio`     | Posts that include audio                                             |
| `has:media`     | Posts that include any media                                         |
| `has:poll`      | Posts that have a poll                                               |
| `has:link`      | Posts that have a link                                               |
| `has:embed`     | Posts that have embedded content                                     |

As this feature is further developed, more modifiers may become available.

### Operators

- To exclude content using a modifier, include a `-` operator as part of the search. For example, `-has:media` would exclude any post that includes media attachments.
- When you include multiple search terms or modifiers together, there is a hidden `AND` between each component.
- There is currently not an `OR` type operator.
- To search for a specific multi-word phrase, put the term in single or double quotes like `'Search Term'` or `"Search Term"`

### Examples

- Searching for `Star Wars` will return posts that contain both the word `Star` and `Wars` but not necessarily `Star Wars`.
- Searching for `'Star Wars'` or `"Star Wars"` will only return posts that contain the exact combonation.
- To see all indexed posts which mention the phrase `John Mastodon` AND include an image posted before August 1, 2023, use the following search: `'John Mastodon' has:image before:2023-08-01`
- To see all your posted links before the year 2024 about , use `from:me before:2024 has:link`
- To see all indexed posts for Star Trek that include images but exclude SNW to avoid spoilers, for example, use `'Star Trek' has:image -SNW`
- To see posts from [@vmstan] that mention "coffee" but exclude any replies, use `from:vmstan -is:reply coffee`
