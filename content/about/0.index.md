# About

vmst.io is Mastodon for respectful technologists, geeks and nerds of every type and stripe.

## History

vmst.io was started by [@vmstan](https://vmst.io/@vmstan) (Michael) on October 6, 2022.
Michael had originally joined Mastodon as a member of the now-defunct [mastodon.technology](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/) (m.t) site.
Having considered starting his own instance for a while, Michael used an existing domain he owned to create what was originally intended to be a single-user instance.
After inviting a few friends to explore Mastodon, it was decided to open the instance to the public later that month.
Michael then applied and was accepted to list vmst.io on the official Mastodon project server directory.

In November 2022, a certain eccentric billionaire took control of another popular social media platform, and Mastodon experienced explosive growth.
vmst.io gained thousands of new members almost overnight.
We have been online ever since.

## Federation

Mastodon is built on open standards, using sustainable technologies (i.e. no blockchain) that have powered the web for decades.
ActivityPub is what makes social networks like Mastodon work across different servers, kind of like how email lets you message people regardless of whether they use Gmail or Outlook.
When you're on one server (vmst.io) and want to follow someone on another, our server talks to their server to exchange information, just like postal services from different countries work together to deliver mail internationally.

Think of each server as a community center that keeps copies of messages for its members.
When you post something, our server shares it with all the other servers where your followers are, and they show it to the right people.
This means you can be on Server A and still see posts from your friend on Server B, even though you're in different places â€“ the servers handle all the communication behind the scenes to make it feel seamless.

The actual process of delivering content between servers, often referred to as federation, isn't anywhere near as clean looking as the chart below might suggest, with 10,000 servers alone running Mastodon, and thousands of other servers running Pixelfed, Lemmy, Misskey, Akkoma, Gotosocial, micro.blog, Threads, Mbin and [so much more](https://fedidb.org/software).

vmst.io servers handle millions of these jobs per day.
