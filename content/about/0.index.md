But Mastodon isn’t just the vmst.io domain, or a single website—it is a federation of nearly ten-thousand independent communities (and growing) running Mastodon to form a coherent network, where, while every server is different, each one is part of the whole. Mastodon is built on open standards, using sustainable technologies (i.e. no blockchain) that have powered the web for decades.

Thanks to the network's spread-out and independent nature, there are more moderators who you can approach for personal help, and servers with strict codes of conduct. It also has tools to help you manage your usage, limit notifications, and control your experience. Mastodon comes with effective anti-abuse tools to help protect yourself.

Mastodon is also part of a larger system of ActivityPub-powered sites that can all interact together. There are millions of users across nearly 29,000 ActivityPub-powered sites. Some like Mastodon, some more like other video and picture-sharing social media sites you're used to on the Internet. Without lock-in, without making you the product.
