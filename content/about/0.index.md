# About

vmst.io is Mastodon for respectful technologists, geeks and nerds of every type and stripe.

## History

vmst.io was started by [@vmstan](https://vmst.io/@vmstan) (Michael) on October 6, 2022.
Michael had originally joined Mastodon as a member of the now-defunct [mastodon.technology](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/) (m.t) site.
Having considered starting his own server for a while, Michael used an existing domain he owned to create what was originally intended to be a single-user server.

After inviting a few friends to explore Mastodon with him, he decided to open the server to public registration, later that month.
Michael then applied, and was accepted, to list vmst.io on the Mastodon project's [server directory](https://joinmastodon.org/servers).

In November 2022, a certain eccentric billionaire took control of another popular social media platform, and Mastodon experienced explosive growth.
vmst.io gained thousands of new members almost overnight.

Around this time, [@djwfyi](https://vmst.io/@djwfyi) (Daryl) decided to move his account from a different server to vmst.io, mostly because of our extensive collection of [custom Star Trek emoji](/about/emoji).
Shortly after, Daryl was promoted to Moderator and then to Administrator.
Now he can never leave.

## Staff

All of the staff members of vmst.io are volunteers.

There is a limited set of people with administrative controls to our core applications and infrastructure.
In the event of a disaster which limits those people from performing their duties, alternatives have been identified to take control of our system and insure continuity of operations.
