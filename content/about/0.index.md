# About

vmst.io is Mastodon for respectful technologists, geeks and nerds of every type and stripe.

## History

vmst.io was founded by [@vmstan](https://vmst.io/@vmstan) (Michael) on October 6, 2022.
Michael initially joined Mastodon as a member of the now-defunct [mastodon.technology](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/) (m.t) instance.
After contemplating starting his own server for some time, he repurposed an existing domain he owned to create what was originally intended to be a single-user server.

After inviting a few friends to explore Mastodon with him, Michael decided to open the server to public registration later that month.
He then applied for, and was accepted into, the Mastodon project's [server directory](https://joinmastodon.org/servers).

In November 2022, Mastodon experienced explosive growth following the acquisition of another popular social media platform by a certain eccentric billionaire.
vmst.io gained thousands of new members almost overnight.

Around this time, [@djwfyi](https://vmst.io/@djwfyi) (Daryl) moved his account from another server to vmst.io, drawn by its extensive collection of [custom Star Trek emoji](/about/emoji).
Shortly thereafter, Daryl was promoted to Moderator and then to Administrator.

Now, he can never leave.

## Staff

All of the staff members of vmst.io are volunteers.

There is a limited set of people with administrative controls to our core applications and infrastructure.
In the event of a disaster which limits those people from performing their duties, alternatives have been identified to take control of our system and insure continuity of operations.
