# About

Fill your social media feed with what matters to you.

vmst.io runs Mastodon which is powered by ActivityPub, which links to over ten-thousand independent communities (and growing) running Mastodon and other compatiable platforms to form a coherent network. Mastodon is built on open standards, using sustainable technologies (i.e. no blockchain) that have powered the web for decades.

Thanks to the network's spread-out and independent nature, there are more moderators who you can approach for personal help, and servers with strict codes of conduct. It also has tools to help you manage your usage, limit notifications, and control your experience. Mastodon comes with effective anti-abuse tools to help protect yourself.
