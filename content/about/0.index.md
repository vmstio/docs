Fill your social media feed with what matters to you.

vmst.io runs Mastodon which is powered by ActivityPub, which links to over ten-thousand independent communities (and growing) running Mastodon and other compatiable platforms to form a coherent network.
Mastodon is built on open standards, using sustainable technologies (i.e. no blockchain) that have powered the web for decades.

![Federation](/federation.png)

Actual federation isn't anywhere near as clean looking as the chart above, with 10,000 servers alone running Mastodon, and thousands of other servers running Pixelfed, Lemmy, Misskey, Akkoma, Gotosocial, micro.blog, Threads, Mbin and [so much more](https://fedidb.org/software).
