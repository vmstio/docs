# Bird UI

Bird UI is an alternative theme for the main Mastodon web interface and provides an interface similar to what you might find from legacy Birdsites.

The code for Bird UI is maintained by [Roni Laukkarinen](https://vmst.io/@rolle@mementomori.social).
It is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/mastodon-bird-ui).

To enable Bird UI on your vmst.io account, visit Preferences > [Appearance](https://vmst.io/settings/preferences/appearance) > Site Theme > Bird UI.

:button-link[Enable Bird UI]{icon="fluent-emoji-high-contrast:bird" href="https://vmst.io/settings/preferences/appearance" blank}

This will work with the default single-column or Advanced multi-column layout options.
There are also High Contrast and Light color theme options available.
Unlike the default Mastodon theme, there is currently no automatic color switching for the Bird UI with your system light/dark settings.

To disable Bird UI, simply select one of the default Mastodon themes from the same control panel option.

_This option was previously known as Elephant in the web interface_.
