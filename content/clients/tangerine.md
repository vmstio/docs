# Tangerine

Tangerine is an alternative theme for the main Mastodon web interface.

The code for Tangerine is maintained by [NilÃ©ane](https://vmst.io/@nileane@nileane.fr).
It is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/nileane/TangerineUI-for-Mastodon).

To enable Tangerine on your vmst.io account, visit Preferences > [Appearance](https://vmst.io/settings/preferences/appearance) > Site Theme > Tangerine.

:button-link[Enable Tangerine]{icon="fluent-emoji-high-contrast:tangerine" href="https://vmst.io/settings/preferences/appearance" blank}

Tangerine will automatically switch between dark and light mode based on your system settings.
There are also multiple color variants like Cherry and Lagoon, and for folks who like the layout options of Tangerine, but prefer the stock Mastodon color scheme, there is also a purple option.

To disable Tangerine, select one of the default Mastodon themes from the same control panel option.
