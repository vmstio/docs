# Developers

If you are the developer of a Mastodon client or another ActivityPub/Fediverse project and would like to use an account on vmst.io to test the functionality of your application, please contact [@vmstan](https://vmst.io/@vmstan) before doing so.

While we are generally supportive of such things, we like to know ahead of time should it cause disruptions in service to other members.

Development accounts designed to scrape and/or index user data via our API or other means are prohibited.
