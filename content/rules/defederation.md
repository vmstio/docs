title: Defederation

# Defederation

We "defederate" vmst.io from other servers that are incompatible with our fundamental rules, in an effort to protect our users and limit our liability.
The decision to defederate can come from reports by our users but is also based on community discussion around such bad actors, including the periodic import of community-maintained blocklists.
We would rather be proactive in blocking bad actors versus waiting for abuse to happen.

## Blocklists

We believe community-maintained blocklists serve an important purpose to help jump-start servers in providing protection to users from abusive or disruptive individuals.

We choose to use extremely high-consensus threshold lists for our suspension (blocked) list to prevent breaking connections from users unnecessarily.
We have a lower threshold for importing limitation (muted) lists as these changes can be undone without breaking user connections.

### Sources

### Sensitivity

Our defederated server list includes domains where the name itself may contain offensive language, or the resulting site contains harmful or illegal materials. As a result, the domains are partially redacted when viewing on the [vmst.io/about](https://vmst.io/about) listing.

::alert{type="warning"}
When you view this list or visit these sites, you do so at your own discretion and/or liability.

## Reporting

If during your use of the platform, you find another server that you think needs to be restricted from interacting with ours **or** if you feel that another server may have been blocked by our staff in error, please file an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/vmstan/mastodon/issues/new/choose).
If you'd feel more comfortable, you can also reach out to one or more of our staff directly via private mention.
