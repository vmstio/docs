# Transphobia

Misgendering, the act of referring to someone using a gender or pronouns that do not correctly reflect their gender identity, is prohibited.
Deliberate or targeted misgendering, where there is an intentional refusal to respect an individual's self-identified gender and pronouns, is considered a form of harassment and discrimination.

Deadnaming, which involves referring to a transgender or gender-diverse person by a name they used before their gender transition, is prohibited.
