# NSFW

We request that users refrain from posting sexually explicit content using their vmst.io accounts.
While the definition of what is considered explicit might differ from region to region, this is generally understood to be content that would be considered explicit for users in the United States and Canada where our services are hosted.

Absolutely under no circumstance is 18+ content allowed without a content warning.
Sexual content which violates consent is expressly prohibited.

## Federated Content

Users are **not** generally prohibited from following accounts from other servers that post explicit content, even if we do not permit posting it locally.
As a result, explicit content may show up on the Federated timeline where it’s viewable by all members.

Moderators will make an effort to issue limitations to remote accounts who regularly post explicit content.
Limiting the account will enable those who directly follow the account to continue accessing it, while preventing its visibility on the Federated timeline.

If local accounts are deemed to be following such content in an attempt to “poison” the federated timeline, those accounts will be suspended.

## CSAM

The use of your account to view CSAM (child sexual abuse materials) including CG-CSAM (computer-generated) or other fictionalized sexualized media (lolicon) is expressly prohibited and will result in an immediate account suspension, removal of content, and reporting to the appropriate law enforcement officials.

This includes content posted locally or viewed through a federated server. In the event you inadvertently observe content through our system of this nature, we expect it to be reported to our staff immediately.
