# Advertising

The prohibition against advertising primarily applies to sponsored posting, where users are financially compensated for their content.
While there is considerable nuance in implementation, here are the key points:

## Permitted Content

- Personal artwork sales and services (when not excessive)
- Author book promotions and sales links (when not excessive)
- Relevant crowdfunding links
- Charitable and mutual aid donation requests
- Product reviews where items were provided to reviewers (when posted externally)

## Prohibited Content

- Direct promotional posts on vmst.io for sponsored products
- Content with affiliate links intended to generate revenue or track user activity
- Excessive self-promotion that dominates account activity
