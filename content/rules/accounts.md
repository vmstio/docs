# Account Sign-Up

In order to keep the number of junk accounts on vmst.io as low as possible, we ask you to:

::list{type="success"}
- Register for an account at [vmst.io/auth/sign_up](https://vmst.io/auth/sign_up)
- Verify your provided email address by clicking a link we'll send to you from [mastodon@ses.vmst.io](/infrastructure/mailer)
- Complete a [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com) verification
- Wait while our moderation system approves your account for use
::

::alert{type="danger"}
All new account requests that do not complete email and hCaptcha verification **within 72 hours** are automatically deleted.
If our systems identify your account request as a risk, we may decline it or requests additional information before approval.

## Preserving Your Account

Some servers are happy to juice their registration numbers with drive-by registrations.
We want to set a higher bar and advertise folks who are part of our community.
As such expect that all accounts on vmst.io will be active, at some point.
You can be a lurker, but if you sign up and never come back we reserve the right to delete your account.

The intention is not to delete accounts which fall out of use, only to avoid namesquatting or artificially boosting our registration numbers.
We also feel this helps mitigate against sleeper attacks, where accounts are created and sit idle until activated later, to appear with older registration dates, and hence bypass other anti-abuse migitations built into the platform.

Complete any of the following actions to confirm the account is not abandoned:

- [Set profile information](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/), such as by adding an avatar or filling out biography information.
- Add [multi-factor authentication](https://fedi.tips/using-two-factor-authentication-2fa-on-mastodon/) to an account.
- Add a post, boost a post, or reply to any post.

If you join vmst.io and decide it isn't the best home for your Mastodon experience, you also have the ability to [move](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#migration) or [delete](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#delete) your own account at any time.

::alert{type="info"}
Accounts that are created but show no activity within the first 30 days are subject to suspension, pending deletion.
