# Account Approvals

In order to keep the number of junk accounts on vmst.io as low as possible, we ask you to:

::list{type="success"}
- Sign up for an account at [vmst.io/auth/sign_up](https://vmst.io/auth/sign_up)
- Verify your provided email address by clicking a link we'll send to you from [mastodon@ses.vmst.io](/infrastructure/mailer)
- Complete a [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com) verification
::

New accounts are subject to approval of our moderation staff.
If our systems identify your account request as a risk, we may decline it or requests additional information before approval.

::alert{type="danger"}
All new account requests that do not complete email and hCaptcha verification **within 72 hours** are automatically deleted.

## Preserving Your Account

We generally want all accounts on vmst.io to be active at some point.
You can be a lurker, and never post, but if you sign up and never come back we reserve the right to delete your account.

Complete any of the following actions to confirm the account is not abandoned:

- [Set profile information](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/), such as by adding an avatar or filling out biography information.
- Add [multi-factor authentication](https://fedi.tips/using-two-factor-authentication-2fa-on-mastodon/) to an account.
- Add a post, boost a post, or reply to any post.

You also have the ability to [move](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#migration) or [delete](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#delete) your own account at any time.

::alert{type="info"}
Accounts that are created but show no activity within the first 30 days are subject to deletion.
::

The intention is not to delete accounts which fall out of use, only to avoid namesquatting or artificially boosting our registration numbers.
