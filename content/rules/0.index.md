# Rules

We want to foster an environment where people of _all types and stripes_ feel welcome.
Our rules are meant to be clear and direct, but the staff of this server has ultimate discretion on how they are enforced.
We may alter these rules as needed, but will make an effort to notify you of any major change.

## Rule Violations

If you are found to be in violation, the staff may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the server.
We have documented our [moderation process](/rules/moderation) to be as open as possible.

If you find content that is in violation of the Server Rules, please [report the offending account](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/#report).

You may also [take other actions](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/) on your own, such as muting or blocking the account, or the entire domain/server.

## Fediverse Norms

Outside of our rules, there are certain "norms" of Mastodon, and the wider "Fediverse" that you'll be expected to follow while a member of this server.

For example, include [content warnings](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw) when necessary, mark media as [sensitive](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw) as appropriate, and regularly use [descriptive text](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#edit) (or "Alt Text") for image uploads.

Some of these norms may be different than what you're used to on other platforms.
While failure to use these is not strictly moderation-worth events, we do ask that you respect and try to conform to these norms as you explore and grow on the platform.

## Hashtags Overuse

Due to the federated nature of Mastodon, and current limitations in searching, hashtags are used to help with content delivery and discovery.
However, their overuse can be disruptive and degrade their value.

Users who misuse or overuse hashtags may be asked by server staff to stop, or have limitations placed on their account which would prevent their non-followers from discovering their content.
Continued misuse may result in temporary or permanent account suspension.
