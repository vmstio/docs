# Rules

We want to foster an environment where people of _all types and stripes_ feel welcome.
Fundamentally we require all of our members to treat others with respect, even when there is disagreement.
Our rules are meant to be clear and direct, but the staff of this server has ultimate discretion on how they are enforced.
