# Rules

We want to foster an open discussion where **everyone** feels welcome.
The rules are meant to be clear and direct, but the staff of this server has ultimate discretion on how they are enforced.
We may alter these rules as needed, but will make an effort to notify you of any major change.

## Rule Violations

If you find content that is in violation of the Server Rules, please [report the offending account](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/#report).

You may also [take other actions](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/) on your own, such as muting or blocking the account, or the entire domain/server.

### Moderation Process

We have documented our [moderation process](/rules/process) to be as open as possible.

## Transphobia

Misgendering, the act of referring to someone using a gender or pronouns that do not correctly reflect their gender identity, is prohibited.
Deliberate or targeted misgendering, where there is an intentional refusal to respect an individual's self-identified gender and pronouns, is considered a form of harassment and discrimination.

Deadnaming, which involves referring to a transgender or gender-diverse person by a name they used before their gender transition, is prohibited.

## Brand Accounts

Please see our policy page on [Brand](/rules/brands) accounts.

## Bot Accounts

Please see our policy page on [Bot](/rules/bots) accounts.

## Following Norms

There are certain "norms" of Mastodon, and the wider "Fediverse" that you'll be expected to follow while a member of this server.

For example, include [content warnings](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw) when necessary, mark media as [sensitive](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw) as appropriate, and regularly use [descriptive text](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#edit) (or "Alt Text") for image uploads.

Some of these norms may be different than what you're used to on other platforms.
While failure to use these is not strictly moderation-worth events, we do ask that you respect and try to conform to these norms as you explore and grow on the platform.
