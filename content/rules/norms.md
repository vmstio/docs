# Norms

Outside of our [Rules](/rules), there are certain "norms" of Mastodon and the Fediverse that you'll be expected to respect while you are a member of this server.
Some of these norms may be different than what you're used to on other platforms.

While failure to abide by these rules not strictly moderation-worth events, we do ask that you respect and try to conform to these norms as you explore and grow on the platform.

## Content Warnings

Using content warnings shows consideration for community members' wellbeing and helps create a more supportive online environment where people feel their needs are respected.

For content which others may find shocking or objectionable, please use [content warnings](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw) when necessary or mark the media as [sensitive](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw).

Content warnings help people avoid content that could trigger distressing memories or emotional responses.
Some people may be more sensitive to certain types of content due to neurological differences, sensory processing issues, or other conditions.
They also help people avoid accidentally displaying sensitive content in work or public environments where it would be inappropriate.

## Alt-Text

Users are encouraged to regularly use [descriptive text](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#edit) (or "Alt-Text") for image uploads.

Alt-text allows those with visual impairments who use screen readers to understand image content.
Even for sighted users, well-written alt-text can provide additional context or details that enhance understanding of the image and overall content.

It's important to be descriptive but concise.
The goal is to maintain the same meaning and user experience for everyone, regardless of how they access the content.

## Hashtags Overuse

Due to the federated nature of Mastodon, and current limitations in searching, hashtags are used to help with content delivery and discovery.
However, their overuse can be disruptive and degrade their value.

Users who misuse or overuse hashtags may be asked by server staff to stop, or have limitations placed on their account which would prevent their non-followers from discovering their content.
Continued misuse may result in temporary or permanent account suspension.

## Content Attibution

Sharing content created by others must include clear attribution to the original author, creator, or source.
Avoid sharing content that you do not have the proper permission or license to distribute.

While sharing AI-generated content is allowed, it must include a disclosure indicating its origin.
Accounts should not exclusively post AI-generated content.
