# Large Language Models

A large language model, like ChatGPT, is a type of "artificial intelligence" program designed to understand and generate human-like text by processing vast amounts of written language.
While the creation and use of large language models are not inherently unethical or illegal, there are many important questions about how companies obtain their data to train their models and how that data is used.

vmst.io has taken some steps to limit organizations who build these models from accessing your public post data.
In some cases, this involves directly blocking the accessibility of third-parties to our site through firewalls, but in most cases, this is done by requesting that they not index our site through user agent flags in our [robots.txt](https://vmst.io/robots.txt) file.
