# Automation

We use the open source [n8n](https://n8n.io/) platform to perform automation tasks and send notifications.
n8n is similar to Zapier, IFTTT, or Power Automate, but can be self-hosted.

n8n connects the various APIs from Mastodon, Patreon, Ko-fi, and GitHub.

n8n runs on our main Kubernetes cluster.
