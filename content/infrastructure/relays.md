# Relays

Relays allow all content from participating servers to be directly federated to everyone else, without waiting for a direct user connection to be established.
This helps with content discovery and more to complete conversation threads and hashtags for our users.

Federation and content discovery still happen without relays, but relays create an express lane between servers who participate.
