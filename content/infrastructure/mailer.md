# E-mail

All email notifications associated with the vmst.io Mastodon server should come from: `no-reply@vmst.io`.

* We use [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) as our managed SMTP service, used for sending new user sign-up verifications, and other account notifications.
* We leverage industry technologies like `SPF` and `DKIM` to help verify we are the only ones sending you emails.
* We use **[Fastmail](https://fastmail.com)** for receiving and sending non-automated messages in the `@vmst.io` domain.

When you sign up for an account, and you provide us with an email address, we promise to only contact you there regarding your Mastodon account.
