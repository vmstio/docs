## Overview

The purpose of vmcrawl is to collect and report information about adoption of patching for Mastodon instances.
It is not designed to be a discovery tool of all available Mastodon instances.

- Follow the crawler on Mastodon: [@vmcrawl](https://vmst.io/@vmcrawl)
- 
### Deployment

vmcrawl is open source and available for anyone to run on their own.

Realistically, there is terrible version management because the schema and methods are not fully documented and sometimes the software changes in ways that may break, if you're not the developer.
The code is there mostly for validation of the data we collect and to help ensure that we're not violating any terms of service.

If you have concerns about our particular implementation, please raise an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/vmstio/vmcrawl/issues) or contact us at [admin@vmst.io](mailto:admin@vmst.io).

### Infrastructure

vmcrawl runs on the same backend [infrastructure](/about/infrastructure) as the vmst.io Mastodon instance, from DigitalOcean data centers around the world.

## Crawled Endpoints

vmcrawl may attempt to access the following endpoints of your Fediverse server:

- `/robots.txt`
- `/.well-known/host-meta`
- `/.well-known/webfinger`
- `/.well-known/nodeinfo` + [referenced JSON](https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software)

vmcrawl will validate information about Mastodon instances by accessing the following endpoints:

- `/api/v2/instance` or `/api/v1/instance`

vmcrawl may periodically attempt to access the following endpoint from known Mastodon instances:

- `/api/v1/instance/peers`

## User Agent

The vmcrawl user agent can be identified as: `vmcrawl/0.x (https://docs.vmst.io/vmcrawl)`

## Opt-Out

If you would like to opt-out, there are a variety of methods available, the preferred method being to modify your `robots.txt` file.

### robots.txt

You can add the following to your `robots.txt` file:

```
User-agent: vmcrawl
Disallow: /
```

It will also respect a disallow of `*` (all) bots/crawlers.

### HTTP Response

Responding with or an HTTP 410, 418, or 451 reply will block vmcrawl from crawling your server.

## Collected Data

vmcrawl collects the following data only from servers that it identifies as Mastodon, or a related fork:

- Software Version
- Monthly Active User Count

vmcrawl may periodically request a list of peers from a server, but only to discover new servers to request the data outlined above.

Peer information for specific servers is **not** retained.

### Retention

vmcrawl displays version data for servers that have responded to a crawl attempt within the last three days.

## Results

Some servers may not appear in our results based on many factors:

### Uncrawled Servers

- Servers may opt-out, as outlined above
- Servers may be running older versions of Mastodon (before 3.0)
- Servers may require authentication to the instance API endpoint
- Servers may report distorted versions, or no active user count information
- Servers may have [improperly configured](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#web_domain) WebFinger or Host-Meta ["well-known" endpoints](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/dev/routes/#well-known)
- Servers may be running a fork of Mastodon where the [NodeInfo](http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software) no longer identifies itself as Mastodon (e.g., Hometown, Kmyblue)
- Servers may fail to respond or block our crawl in other ways, most commonly when [Cloudflare returns HTTP 403](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/4xx-client-error/error-403/#cloudflare-specific-information) codes on required endpoints

### Not Reported

vmcrawl may collect and report aggregated data from servers that appear on the [IFTAS DNI](https://about.iftas.org/library/iftas-dni-list/) list, but these servers will not appear in the detailed instance results.
