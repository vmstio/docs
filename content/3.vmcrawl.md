## Crawled Endpoints

vmcrawl may attempt to access the following endpoints of your Fediverse server:

- `/robots.txt`
- `/.well-known/webfinger`
- `/.well-known/nodeinfo` 
- Any referenced JSON [nodeinfo](https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software) document

vmcrawl will validate information about Mastodon instances by accessing the following endpoints:

- `/api/v1/instance`

vmcrawl may periodically attempt to access the following endpoint from known Mastodon instances:

- `/api/v1/instance/peers`

## User Agent

The vmcrawl user agent can be identified as: `vmcrawl/0.x (https://docs.vmst.io/vmcrawl)`

### robots.txt

If you would like to stop vmcrawl from checking your server, you can add the following to your `robots.txt` file:

```
User-agent: vmcrawl
Disallow: /
```

It will also respect a disallow of all bots/crawlers in this file, or an HTTP 410 or 418 reply to any endpoint.

## Collected Data

vmcrawl collects the following data only from servers that it identifies as Mastodon, or a related fork:

- Software Version
- Total User Count
- Monthly Active User Count

vmcrawl may periodically request a list of peers from a server, but only to discover new servers to request the data outlined above.

**vmcrawl does not store specific peer information for any server.**

## Uncrawled Servers

Some servers may not appear in our results based on many factors:

- Servers may opt-out by blocking our user agent as outlined above
- Servers may be on sub-domains which are known to be development instances
- Servers may be running older versions of Mastodon which lack the proper APIs
- Servers may have restricted access to the `/api/v1/instance` endpoint
- Servers may report distorted version or user count information
- Servers may have an improperly configured WebFinger configuration (see `WEB_DOMAIN` in [Mastodon Documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#web_domain))
- Servers may have punycode domains (🦄.social)

## Deployment

vmcrawl is open source and available for anyone to run on their own.
Realistically, you shouldn't because the code and database schema are not fully documented and version controlled and sometimes change in ways that may break if you're not the developer.
The code is there mostly to examine and validate the data we collect and to help ensure that we're not violating any terms of service.

If you have concerns about our particular implementation, or would like to permanently opt-out in a way not outlined above, please raise an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/vmstio/vmcrawl/issues) or contact us at [admin@vmst.io](mailto:admin@vmst.io).
We have taken steps to ensure that our data collection practices are transparent and ethical.

vmcrawl runs on the same backend [infrastructure](/about/infrastructure) as the vmst.io Mastodon instance, from the DigitalOcean Toronto (Canada) data center.
There are also remote collectors hosted by Hetzner Cloud, on arm64 virtual servers hosted on their Ampere platforms, in Nuremberg (Germany) and Helsinki (Finland).
