## Crawled Endpoints

vmcrawl may attempt to access the following endpoints of your Fediverse server:

- `/robots.txt`
- `/.well-known/webfinger`
- `/.well-known/nodeinfo`

Based on those results, if it's determined that your server is running Mastodon, it may access:

- `/api/v2/instance` for Mastodon 4.x
- `/api/v1/instance` for Mastodon 3.x

vmcrawl may periodically attempt to access the following endpoint from known deployments:

- `/api/v1/instance/peers`

## User Agent

The vmcrawl user agent can be identified as: `vmcrawl/0.x (https://docs.vmst.io/vmcrawl)`

### robots.txt

If you would like to stop vmcrawl from checking your server, you can add the following to your `robots.txt` file:

```
User-agent: vmcrawl
Disallow: /
```

It will also respect a disallow of all bots/crawlers in this file, or an HTTP 410 reply to any endpoint.

## Collected Data

vmcrawl collects the following data only from servers that it identifies as Mastodon, or a related fork:

- Software Version
- Total & Active Users Count
- Administrator Address
- Code Repository

vmcrawl may periodically request a list of peers from a server, but only to discover new servers to request the data outlined above.
**It does not store specific peer information for any server.**

## Uncrawled Servers

Some servers may not appear in our results based on many factors:

- Servers may opt-out by blocking our user agent as outlined above
- Servers may be on sub-domains which are known to be development instances
- Servers may deny unauthenticated access to their public instance API
- Servers may be running older versions of Mastodon which lack the proper APIs
- Servers may report distorted version or user count information
- Servers may have an improperly configured WebFinger configuration (see `WEB_DOMAIN` in [Mastodon Documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#web_domain))
- Servers may have punycode domains (🦄.social)
