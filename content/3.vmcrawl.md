## Overview

The purpose of vmcrawl is to collect and report information about adoption of patching for Mastodon instances.
It is not designed to be a discovery tool of all available Mastodon instances.

## Crawled Endpoints

vmcrawl may attempt to access the following endpoints of your Fediverse server:

- `/robots.txt`
- `/.well-known/webfinger`
- `/.well-known/nodeinfo` 
- Any referenced JSON [nodeinfo](https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software) document

vmcrawl will validate information about Mastodon instances by accessing the following endpoints:

- `/api/v1/instance`

vmcrawl may periodically attempt to access the following endpoint from known Mastodon instances:

- `/api/v1/instance/peers`

## User Agent

The vmcrawl user agent can be identified as: `vmcrawl/0.x (https://docs.vmst.io/vmcrawl)`

## Blocking

If you would like to opt-out, there are a variety of methods available, the preferred method being to modify your `robots.txt` file.

### robots.txt

You can add the following to your `robots.txt` file:

```
User-agent: vmcrawl
Disallow: /
```

It will also respect a disallow of `*` (all) bots/crawlers.

If vmcrawl cannot access the `robots.txt` file on your server (or you don't have one), your instance will **not** be crawled.

### HTTP Response

Responding with or an HTTP 410, 418, or 451 reply will block vmcrawl from crawling your server.

### IP Address

Blocking the source IP address will stop vmcrawl from crawling your server, but may be problematic as our IP address is shared across multiple servers and are subject to change.

## Collected Data

vmcrawl collects the following data only from servers that it identifies as Mastodon, or a related fork:

- Software Version
- Monthly Active User Count

vmcrawl may periodically request a list of peers from a server, but only to discover new servers to request the data outlined above.

Peer information for specific servers is **not** retained.

## Uncrawled Servers

vmcrawl may report a total number of reported instances and active users that is **lower** than other sources, such as [FediDB](https://fedidb.com) or [instances.social](https://instances.social), due to stricter guidelines on how we crawl servers and a keen focus on providing clean data.

Some servers may not appear in our results based on many factors:

- Servers may opt-out, as outlined above
- Servers may be running on known development platforms
- Servers may be running older versions of Mastodon (before 3.0)
- Servers may require authentication to the instance API endpoint
- Servers may report distorted versions, or no active user count information
- Servers may have an improperly configured WebFinger configuration
- Servers may have punycode domains (🦄.social)
- Servers may appears on the [IFTAS DNI](https://about.iftas.org/library/iftas-dni-list/) list

## Deployment

vmcrawl is open source and available for anyone to run on their own.

Realistically, you shouldn't because the code and database schema are not fully documented and sometimes the software changes in ways that may break things for you, if you're not the developer.
The code is there mostly to examine and validate the data we collect and to help ensure that we're not violating any terms of service.

If you have concerns about our particular implementation, or would like to permanently opt-out in a way not outlined above, please raise an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/vmstio/vmcrawl/issues) or contact us at [admin@vmst.io](mailto:admin@vmst.io).

### Infrastructure

vmcrawl runs on the same backend [infrastructure](/about/infrastructure) as the vmst.io Mastodon instance, from the DigitalOcean Toronto (Canada) data center.
There are also remote collectors hosted by Hetzner Cloud, on arm64 virtual servers hosted on their Ampere platforms, in Nuremberg (Germany) and Helsinki (Finland).
