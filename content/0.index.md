  ::list
  - We run the [latest available Mastodon code](/infrastructure/source), **usually before anyone else**, and regularly [contribute fixes back to the Mastodon project](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avmstan+is%3Amerged).
  - We're built to be [highly performant and highly available](/infrastructure), **taking ownership of issues** when we're not. We also publish [our realtime system status](https://status.vmst.io), and strive for better than 99.9% observed availability.
  - We are well moderated, with multiple volunteer [staffers around the world](/about/staff) monitoring for user reports, with clear [rules against hate speech and harassment](/rules). We [proactively defederate](/rules/defederation) from known bad actors to **protect our users**.
  - We believe in **giving you options** in how you use Mastodon and experience the Fediverse. We integrate popular third-party themes like [Bird UI](/clients/bird) and [Tangerine](/clients/tangerine) directly into your preference options, as well as hosting our own copies of [Elk](/clients/elk) and [Phanpy](/clients/phanpy)!
  - We are [100% member funded](/funding)! We have **no corporate sponsors or venture capitalist backers**. Our shareholders are our staff and users. While access to your account **does not require a paid subscription**, for those that can afford it we have [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/vmstio) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vmstan) as ways to help on a monthly basis.
  - We have an A+ rating from [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/vmst.io) and [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=vmst.io&latest), but most importantly **we don't leverage any third party cookies, use trackers or run ads on our service**, as verified by [The Markup's Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=vmst.io).
  - We are currently listed on the [official joinmastodon.org Server Directory](https://joinmastodon.org/servers) under Technology, and as such we are a party to the [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant) which outlines the fundamental expectations for server administration.
