# vmcrawl

vmcrawl is a Mastodon-focused version reporting crawler.
It is written in Python, with a Postgres database backend.
It performs periodic polling of known Mastodon instances.

## Crawled Endpoints

vmcrawl may attempt to access the following endpoints of your Fediverse server:

- `/robots.txt`
- `/.well-known/webfinger`
- `/.well-known/host-meta`
- `/.well-known/nodeinfo`

Based on those results, if it's determined that your server is running Mastodon, it may access:

- `/api/v2/instance` for Mastodon 4.x
- `/api/v1/instance` for Mastodon 3.x

vmcrawl may periodically attempt to access the following endpoint from known deployments:

- `/api/v1/instance/peers`

## User Agent

The vmcrawl user agent can be identified as: `vmcrawl/0.x (https://docs.vmst.io/vmcrawl)`

### robots.txt

If you would like to stop vmcrawl from checking your server, you can add the following to your `robots.txt` file:

```
User-agent: vmcrawl
Disallow: /
```

It will also respect a disallow of all bots/crawlers in this file, or an HTTP 410 reply to any endpoint.

## Collected Data

vmcrawl collects the following data only from servers that it identifies as Mastodon, or a related fork:

- Software Version
- Total & Active Users Count
- Administrator Address
- Code Repository

vmcrawl may periodically request a list of peers from a server, but only to discover new servers to request the data outlined above.
It does not store specific peer information for any server.

## Uncrawled Servers

Some servers may not appear in our results based on many factors:

- Servers may opt-out of `vmcrawl` by blocking our user agent specifically, or that block any crawler
- Servers which appear on the [IFTAS DNI](https://connect.iftas.org/library/iftas-documentation/iftas-dni-list/) list, are not interacted with
- Servers under known junk domains, which can be found [here](https://github.com/vmstio/vmcrawl/blob/main/creation.sql), are skipped
- Servers which do not allow unauthenticated access to their public instance API (as shown above) cannot be included
- Servers running versions of Mastodon prior to 3.0 lack the proper APIs, and cannot be included
- Servers which report suspiscious user counts (ex: active users larger than total users) are not included
- Servers which report distorted version information
