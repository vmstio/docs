# Cost Overview

## Income

The majority of our income comes from monthly subscriptions through [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/vmstio) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vmstan).

## Expenses

At the moment, all of our staff are volunteers, and our only expenses are monthly bills to our various server providers.

| **Vendor**   | **Monthly** |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| DigitalOcean | $430        |
| DeepL        | $7          |
| AWS          | $1          |

Money is set aside to cover any tax expenses or unforeseen costs.
Additional funds have also been used to make donations to open-source software projects that we use, such as Mastodon and Elk.

We also periodically test different service offerings to decide if their long-term use would be a good fit.
After a period of review and testing, we may discontinue such offerings if they do not contribute to the community as shown by use.
